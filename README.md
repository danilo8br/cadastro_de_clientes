Project made with the QTDesigner tool for graphical interface, using the Python language to make the system and to store the data, MySQL was used.

## Why?

- I wanted to do some interface project for a long time, so I did it just for fun and practice :]

## First Screen

- On this screen, if the person is not registered, they have to click to register. If it is, you just need to login.
